Making a Change
---------------

Before making any significant changes, please open an issue. Each issue should describe the following:

	* Requirement - what kind of business use case are you trying to solve?
	* Problem - what missing feature in this project blocks you from solving the requirement?
	* Proposal - what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation?
	* Any open questions to address

Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone. Once the approach is agreed upon, make your changes and open a pull request (PR). It is ideal to look at already open issues and start working from there. Each PR should describe:

	* Which problem it is solving. Normally it should be simply a reference to the corresponding issue, e.g. Fixes #123.
	* What changes are made to achieve that.

Your pull request is most likely to be accepted if each commit:

	* Has a good commit message. In summary:
		- Separate subject from body with a blank line
		- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
		- If it is a feature that it provides a one line sentence of what the feature adds to the project
		- Describes what your are fixing
		- Wrap the body at 72 characters
		- Use the body to explain what and why instead of how
