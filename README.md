# Automatic detection of log anomalies from system log file using Deep Learning. 
## Objective
The main objective of this research project would be to detect anomalies event from system log file using deep learning algorithm.
## Methodology
The tool will analysis the  system log files, apply NLP tool for parsing data and classify the anomaly event. Both rule-based and deep learning algorithm would be considered for best decision model.
## Dataset
The log file dataset would be utilized from the following paper: Guo, Haixuan, Shuhan Yuan, and Xintao Wu. "Logbert: Log anomaly detection via bert." International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN). IEEE, 2021.
## Language 
This project would be in Python language.
