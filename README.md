# Automatic detection of malicious commits in open-source software repositories using Deep Learning. 
## Objective
The main objective of this research project would be to detect anomalous and malicious commits in open-source software (OSS) repositories using deep learning algorithm.
## Methodology
The tool will analysis the  commit log files and repository metadata, collect relevant factors and conclude to a decision. For primary analysis, the tool will focus on the following factors: 1) pull requests 2) sensetive files 3) file changes history 4) contributor trust. Both rule-based and deep learning algorithm would be considered for best decision model.
## Dataset
The OSS malware dataset would be utilized from the following paper: Gonzalez, Danielle, et al. "Anomalicious: Automated detection of anomalous and potentially malicious commits on github." 2021 IEEE/ACM 43rd International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP). IEEE, 2021.
## Language 
This project would be in Python language.
